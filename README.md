🩺 Disease Prediction Toolkit

A Machine Learning project that predicts the risk of heart disease using patient health parameters.
Built with Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and visualizations for insights.

⚙️ Tech Stack

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🤖 Scikit-learn (ML models)

💾 Joblib (model saving/loading)

🌐 Streamlit (interactive web app)

🚀 Features

✅ Data preprocessing and model training
✅ Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✅ Model evaluation with metrics & visualizations
✅ Interactive Streamlit App for predictions
✅ User-friendly UI with sliders & dropdowns
✅ Probability-based prediction output


▶️ Steps to Execute
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Disease-Prediction-Toolkit.git
cd Disease-Prediction-Toolkit

2️⃣ Create & activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run src/app.py

5️⃣ Open in browser

Streamlit will give you a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) → open it and start predicting! 🎉
